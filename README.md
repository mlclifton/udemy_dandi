This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) and created as I follow [this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/share/10bNIh3@osTWiLQ1ydnkOxl4G171PhdJsUCnvioUXM3UgX6h3Au9E9hL8hdVVld5uhlL-u0s/) on using Cursor AI.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This was all produced by Cursor AI - lots of typing in the prompt window, zero typing so far in the editor!
