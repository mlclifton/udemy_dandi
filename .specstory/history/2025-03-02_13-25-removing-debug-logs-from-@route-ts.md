I'll help you remove the debug log messages from the GitHub summarizer route file. I notice there are several `console.log` statements that are used for debugging. I'll remove them while keeping the error logging statements since those are important for production error tracking.

Let me edit the file to remove these debug logs:

```diff
      // Extract API key from headers and repo URL from body
      const apiKey = request.headers.get('x-api-key');
-     console.log('Received request headers:', Object.fromEntries(request.headers.entries()));
-     
      const body = await request.json();
-     console.log('Received request body:', body);
-     
      const { githubUrl } = body;
  
  
        const [owner, repo] = pathParts;
-       console.log('Extracted owner/repo:', { owner, repo });
  
        // First verify the repository exists
```

I've removed all the debug `console.log` statements from the file while preserving the important error logging statements (`console.error`). Specifically, I removed:

1. The log of request headers
2. The log of request body
3. The log of extracted owner/repo information

I kept all the `console.error` statements since these are important for production error tracking and debugging issues in production. The functionality of the API route remains exactly the same, just without the debug logging.

Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with?
